# PoC_Embedded_System

Hello, here are the files of the PoC of Sylvain QUESADA, Pierre-Louis GIFFARD and Nicolas LECOQ, for the Embedded Systems course of ESILV.

The "PoC_sensors.ino" file is the C program that reads the data from the sensors.
The "/I2C-LCD/PoC_Main_Program" is the Python program that processes the data and write in the CSV file.
The "/templated-linear" folder contains the HTML and CSS files of the web application, as well as the CSV file (poc.csv).
